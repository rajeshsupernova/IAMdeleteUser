# IAMdeleteUser
php script to get the list of users from third party api and delete those users if present in AWS IAM

Before you begin, make sure you have the AWS SDK for PHP installed. You can install it using Composer:

```
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```

## Please note that dealing with IAM users and deleting them requires careful consideration and testing in a controlled environment. Always be cautious when performing operations that can modify or delete resources.
